1. wait for DOM to load - build out function that listens for the dom to load, pass it dynamic functions to chain on for DOM manipulation
2. once dom has loaded, fetch me some data from this URL string and return it to me in JSON format - build out function 
3. Take top level keys from these JS objects and manipulate the DOM structure
